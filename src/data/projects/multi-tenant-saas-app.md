### Project Description

In this project, you'll build a **Multi-Tenant CRM** using the Laravel framework. The core goal is to create a CRM that supports multiple tenants (companies or organizations), each with isolated data, while allowing users from each tenant to manage their own CRM data.

The project will help you grasp the core concepts of multi-tenancy, including database separation or data-scoping techniques, user authentication per tenant, and efficient resource management for each tenant's isolated environment.

### Core Features

1. **Tenant Management**:

   - Each tenant (organization) should have its own isolated data.
   - Allow tenants to manage their company details, users, and CRM data (e.g., contacts, leads, and tasks).

2. **User Roles and Authentication**:

   - Implement roles (Admin, Manager, Employee) within each tenant.
   - Admins can manage other users within their organization.
   - Users should only have access to data belonging to their own tenant.

3. **Multi-Tenancy Approach**:

   - Use **multi-database tenancy** (each tenant has its own database) or **single-database tenancy** (data separation using scoping).
   - Ensure efficient tenant switching and isolation through middlewares or service providers.

4. **CRM Functionality**:

   - Basic CRM features: Contact management, lead tracking, task assignments, and pipeline tracking.
   - Each tenant's data should remain private and accessible only to the users of that tenant.

5. **Tenant Signup & Onboarding**:
   - Create a self-signup form for new tenants.
   - Automatically create a database or tenant-specific schema during the signup process.

### Technical Requirements

- **Laravel**: Utilize `stancl/tenancy` or `spatie/laravel-multitenancy` to handle multi-tenancy.
- **Database**: Support for both single-database and multi-database setups (MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- **Authentication**: Use Laravel’s built-in authentication system with custom roles and permissions.
- **Middleware**: Implement middleware to switch tenant context based on domain, subdomain, or request parameters.
- **Event Handling**: Trigger events for tenant creation, such as database migrations or sending welcome emails.

### Optional Features

- **Tenant Billing**: Add support for subscription billing (e.g., Stripe or PayPal) to charge tenants based on their usage.
- **Activity Logs**: Keep track of each tenant’s activity (e.g., user logins, data changes).
- **Tenant Dashboard**: Create a dashboard for each tenant to view their key performance metrics.

### Some Tips

- Start by creating the tenant model and setting up routes for tenant-specific access.
- Use `stancl/tenancy` to automate database creation for each new tenant.
- Implement cache and queue separation for each tenant for better performance.
- Handle data migrations carefully to ensure that new tenants start with the appropriate database schema.

### Conclusion

This project will teach you how to implement multi-tenancy in Laravel, handle database migrations for tenant isolation, and create a scalable application architecture that supports multiple tenants with varying requirements.
