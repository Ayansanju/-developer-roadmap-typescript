This project is designed to help you practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic in JavaScript.

You will create a Tic Tac Toe game where two players can take turns placing their markers (X and O) on a 3x3 grid. The game will check for a win condition after each turn and declare the winner or a draw when appropriate. A reset button will allow players to start a new game at any time.

Here is a mockup of what the Tic Tac Toe game might look like:

This project will help you gain experience with managing game state, handling user input, and creating an engaging user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
