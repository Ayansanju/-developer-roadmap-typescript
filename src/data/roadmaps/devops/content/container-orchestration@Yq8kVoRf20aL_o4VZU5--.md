# Container Orchestration

Container orchestration manages multiple containers in an automated way, handling deployment, scaling, and networking across machines. Tools like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and Apache Mesos automate container scheduling and ensure high availability, scalability, and reliability.

Key features include:

- **Automatic scaling**: Adjusts container numbers based on demand.
- **Load balancing**: Distributes traffic across containers.
- **Self-healing**: Restarts or replaces failed containers.
- **Rolling updates**: Deploys container updates with no downtime.

Container orchestration is crucial for managing complex containerized applications in production environments.
