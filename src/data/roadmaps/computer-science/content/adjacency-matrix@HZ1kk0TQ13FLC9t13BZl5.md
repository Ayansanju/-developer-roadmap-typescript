# Adjacency Matrix

Adjacency Matrix is a square or a grid matrix of N x N size where n is a number of nodes in the graph and it is used to represent the connections between the edges of a graph. Those connections are represented in terms of 0's and 1's( indicating no relationship or no edge and 1 indicating a relationship or an edge connecting two vertices/nodes).
