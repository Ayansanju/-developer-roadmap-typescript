# Component Life Cycle

React components have a lifecycle consisting of three phases: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting along with several “lifecycle methods” that you can override to run code at particular times in the process. You can use this [lifecycle diagram](https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/) as a cheat sheet.

It is not recommended to use lifecycle methods manually. Instead, use the useEffect hook with functional components.
