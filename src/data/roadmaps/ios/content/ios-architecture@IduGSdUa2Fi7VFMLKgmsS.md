# iOS Architecture
iOS architecture refers to the design principles and patterns used to build iOS applications. It focuses on how to structure code, manage data, and ensure a smooth user experience. Following are some architectures used in the iOS development industry:

### 1. Model-View-Controller (MVC)
- _**Model:**_ Represents the data and business logic.
- _**View:**_ Displays the user interface elements.
- _**Controller:**_ Manages the interaction between the Model and View, responding to user input.

### 2. Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)
- _**Model:**_ Similar to MVC, it represents data.
- _**View:**_ The user interface.
- _**ViewModel:**_ Acts as an intermediary, exposing data and commands to the View.

### 3. VIPER
- _**View:**_ Displays data.
- _**Interactor:**_ Contains business logic.
- _**Presenter:**_ Prepares data for the View.
- _**Entity**:_ Represents the data model.
- _**Router:**_ Manages navigation.
  
These architectural patterns help developers create maintainable, scalable, and testable applications while following best practices specific to iOS development. Use cases of these architectures may vary according to the requirements of the application. For example, MVC is used for simple apps, while MVVM is considered when the app is large and complex.
