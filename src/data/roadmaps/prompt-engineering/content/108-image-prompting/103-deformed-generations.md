# Fix Deformed Generations

Deformed generations in image prompting refer to outputs from generative models that do not meet the intended aesthetic or structural quality, i.e. particularly when it involves human body parts like hands and feet. This can include distorted faces, incorrect object proportions, or unrealistic textures. This issue can often be mitigated using negative prompts, which instruct the AI to de-emphasize certain undesired features. Addressing these issues is crucial for improving the quality and reliability of AI-generated images.

### Key Strategies to Fix Deformed Generations:

- **Refine Prompt Design**: Ensure prompts are clear and detailed, specifying desired attributes and styles to guide the model more effectively.
- **Negative Prompts**: These are used to specify what should not appear in the generated image. By including terms like "deformed," "blurry," or "bad anatomy," you can guide the AI to avoid these issues.
- **Weighted Terms**: Assigning weights to negative prompts can further refine the output by emphasizing the importance of avoiding specific deformations.
- **Model Selection**: Choose models known for producing high-quality outputs. Recent advancements have seen improvements in models like DALL-E 3 and Midjourney V5, which offer enhanced capabilities in generating realistic images.
- **Iterative Process**: Achieving the desired image may require multiple attempts, as the technique is not always consistent
- **Feedback Loops**: Implement feedback mechanisms where users can rate or correct generated images, allowing the model to learn from its mistakes and improve over time.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep models updated with the latest training data and techniques to ensure they incorporate recent advancements in AI image generation.
- **Post-Processing Techniques**: Utilize software tools for post-processing, such as image editing applications, to correct minor deformities and enhance overall image quality.

These strategies are essential for anyone working with AI-generated imagery to ensure outputs meet desired standards of quality and realism. As generative models continue to evolve, the need for such techniques is expected to decrease.

Overall, while current models may still struggle with certain deformations, employing negative prompts effectively can significantly enhance image quality.
