# Template Engines
Template engines are tools used in web development to dynamically generate HTML by combining static templates with data. Instead of hardcoding HTML pages, template engines allow developers to create templates with placeholders, which are then populated with data at runtime to produce final HTML that can be sent to the browser. Template engines are widely used in server-side frameworks and help separate the logic of an application from its presentation.

### Key Features of Template Engines
1. **Placeholders and Expressions**: They use placeholders (e.g., `{{variable}}` in many syntaxes) for embedding data directly within the HTML.
2. **Conditional Logic**: Most template engines support conditionals (`if`, `else`) and loops (`for`, `each`) to handle repetitive or conditional content.
3. **Reusability**: You can create reusable templates, partials, and components, which helps in maintaining a modular and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) structure.
4. **Data Binding**: Allows binding of dynamic data from a backend, making it possible to personalize user experiences based on data-driven logic.

### Popular Template Engines
Some widely used template engines are:

- **EJS** (Embedded JavaScript): Used with Node.js, supports JavaScript logic within templates.
- **Pug (formerly Jade)**: Known for its concise syntax, widely used in Express.js applications.
- **Handlebars**: Adds logic-less templating and is popular with both client and server-side rendering.
- **Mustache**: A minimalistic, logic-less engine thatâ€™s language-agnostic and can be used on both frontend and backend.

### Example Use Case
Consider a simple template with a placeholder for a user's name:

```html
<p>Welcome, {{ user.name }}!</p>
```

When rendered with data where `user.name` is "Alice," the engine would output:

```html
<p>Welcome, Alice!</p>
```

Template engines help improve code readability, reusability, and efficiency, making them essential for developing dynamic, data-driven applications.
