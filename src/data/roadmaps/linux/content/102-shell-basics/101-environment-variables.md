# Environment Variables in Linux

In Linux, environment variables are dynamic named values that can affect the behavior of running processes in a shell. They exist in every shell session and provide a simple way to share configuration settings between multiple applications and processes.

Environment variables help to contribute to the flexibility and customization you see in Linux systems. They allow you to store and access important system settings, user preferences, and other configuration data.

To list all the environment variables in a shell session, you can use the `env` command. To print the value of a specific variable, such as the `PATH` variable, you can use the `echo $VARIABLE_NAME` command.

Here's an example on Ubuntu Linux:

```bash
# List all environment variables
$ env

# Print the value of the PATH variable
$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin
```

Remember, different shells (e.g., Bash, Zsh, Fish) may have slightly different syntax and semantics for defining and using environment variables.
