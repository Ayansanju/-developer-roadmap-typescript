# Command Help in Linux

Linux command help is a crucial feature that enables users to navigate the shell commands with ease. This feature provides brief information on how to use these commands. Typing `man` before any command displays the manual entry for that command, explaining its functionality, syntax, and available options. Another popular command is `help`, which is more suitable for shell built-in functions, offering a concise description of each.

These command-line services are extremely beneficial for both beginners learning to use the Linux shell and seasoned users who need to look up the specifics of rarely used commands. You can also get a quick overview of a command's usage with examples by using the `tldr` package.

To view the manual entry for a command, use:

```bash
man [command]
```

For built-in shell functions, use:

```bash
help [command]
```

To view examples with `tldr`, use:

```bash
tldr [command]
```
