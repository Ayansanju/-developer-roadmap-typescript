# Linux Shell Basics

The Linux shell is a powerful command-line interface that allows users to interact directly with the operating system. It serves as an intermediary between the user and the system's kernel, enabling efficient execution of complex tasks. Linux offers various shell options, including the Bourne Shell (sh), the C Shell (csh), and the Bourne-Again Shell (bash), each with its own unique features and capabilities.

The fundamental skills in using a Linux shell include navigating between directories, creating, renaming, and deleting files and directories, as well as executing system commands. This foundational knowledge is crucial for Linux system administration, scripting, and automation.

Here's an example of a classic `bash` command that prints the current working directory:

```bash
roadmap@ubuntu:~$ pwd
/home/roadmap
```

In this example, the `pwd` (print working directory) command is executed in the Bourne-Again Shell (bash) on an Ubuntu Linux system. The output shows that the current working directory is `/home/roadmap`.
