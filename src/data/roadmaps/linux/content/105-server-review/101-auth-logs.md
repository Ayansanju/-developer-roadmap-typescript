# Auth Logs

Regularly reviewing the authentication logs is a crucial task in maintaining the security of a Linux server. These logs, typically located at `/var/log/auth.log` (for Debian-based distributions) or `/var/log/secure` (for Red Hat and CentOS), record all authentication-related events and activities on the server, including system logins, password changes, and sudo commands.

Auth logs are an invaluable tool for monitoring and analyzing the security of your Linux server. They can help you detect brute force login attempts, unauthorized access, and any suspicious behavior. Regularly analyzing these logs is a fundamental step in ensuring server security and data integrity.

Here's an example of how you can use the `tail` command to view the last few entries of the authentication log on an Ubuntu Linux server:

```bash
tail /var/log/auth.log
```
