# Server Review

Conducting a comprehensive server review is a crucial task for System Administrators and DevOps professionals to ensure optimal performance, security, and reliability of Linux-based servers. This process involves assessing the server's configuration, security, and overall health to identify areas for improvement.

In the Linux ecosystem, various tools and commands are available to facilitate the server review process. Depending on the Linux distribution, these tools may vary, but the core functionality remains consistent.

For instance, on Ubuntu Linux, you can use the following commands to gather essential information about your server:

```bash
# Display memory usage information
roadmap@server:~$ free -m

# Show disk usage
roadmap@server:~$ df -h

# Display CPU load and system uptime
roadmap@server:~$ uptime
```

These commands provide valuable insights into the server's resource utilization, allowing you to identify potential bottlenecks or areas that require optimization.
