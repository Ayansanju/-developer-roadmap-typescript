# Debugging in Shell Programming Under Linux

Linux is a robust and flexible operating system that many developers and systems administrators prefer for its versatility and power. Shell programming in Linux enables you to automate tasks and manage systems efficiently. However, given the intricate nature of shell scripts, debugging is an essential skill to handle errors and improve code performance.

When encountering an issue in a shell script, you have several debugging tools at your disposal in a Linux environment. These tools aid in detecting, tracing, and fixing errors or bugs in your shell scripts. Some of these debugging tools include the bash shell's `-x` (or `-v`) options, which allow for execution traces. Other tools like `trap`, `set` command, or even leveraging external debugging tools such as `shellcheck` can also be highly effective.

Consider opening your shell script with the `-x` option for execution tracing, like so:

```bash
#!/bin/bash -x
```

Alternatively, you can run a script in debug mode directly from the command line:

```bash
bash -x script.sh
```

For example, let's say you have a shell script named `roadmap_script.sh` located in the `/home/roadmap/scripts/` directory on an Ubuntu Linux system. You can debug the script using the `-x` option:

```bash
#!/bin/bash -x
echo "Starting roadmap script..."
# Your script code goes here
echo "Roadmap script completed."
```

To run the script in debug mode, execute the following command in the terminal:

```
bash -x /home/roadmap/scripts/roadmap_script.sh
```

This will provide a detailed execution trace, helping you identify and fix any issues in your shell script.

These debugging tools and options can significantly help you in making your scripts more error-proof and efficient.
