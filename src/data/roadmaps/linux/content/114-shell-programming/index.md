# Shell Programming 

Shell programming, also known as shell scripting, is an integral part of the Linux operating system. A shell script is essentially a program that the system's shell executes. While it may not be as powerful as compiled languages like C or C++, shell programming is quite potent for administrative-level tasks, automating repetitive tasks, and system monitoring.

Most Linux distributions come with bash (Bourne Again Shell) as the default shell which is not only an excellent command-line shell, but also an outstanding scripting language. Shell scripts are generally written in a text editor and then can be run directly from the Linux command line.

A simple example of a bash shell script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# My first script
echo "Hello, World!"
```
The 'echo' command prints its argument, in this case "Hello, World!", to the terminal.

Run -
```bash
info bash
```
to read the official bash documentation installed in your linux operating system.
