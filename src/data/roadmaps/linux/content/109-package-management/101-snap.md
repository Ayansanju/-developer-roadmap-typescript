# Snap: Package Management

Snap is a revolutionary package management system developed by Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu. Unlike traditional package managers like dpkg or RPM, Snap offers a self-contained and consistent software delivery approach across various Linux distributions.

Snap packages, known as 'Snaps', include all the necessary dependencies, ensuring that the application runs reliably on different Linux systems. Snaps are installed from the Snapcraft store and are automatically updated in the background. The Snap update process is transactional, meaning that if an update encounters any issues, Snap can seamlessly revert to the previous working version.

Here's an example of how to install a Snap package on Ubuntu Linux:

```bash
sudo snap install [package-name]
```

In the command above, `[package-name]` represents the name of the Snap package you want to install. Remember to run this command with superuser (sudo) privileges, as installing packages requires root access.
