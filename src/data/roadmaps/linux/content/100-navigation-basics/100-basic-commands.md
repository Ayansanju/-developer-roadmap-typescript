# Linux Navigation Basics

Linux Navigation Basics refers to a set of fundamental commands used to navigate and manage the file system in a Linux environment. These commands are essential for users to efficiently move between directories, view file and folder contents, and understand their current location within the system hierarchy. By mastering these basic commands, users can significantly enhance their productivity and control over the Linux file system.

Key commands for Linux navigation include:

1. `cd` (Change Directory): This command allows users to navigate to different directories in the file system.
2. `ls` (List): Used to display the contents of a directory, including files and subdirectories.
3. `pwd` (Print Working Directory): This command shows the current directory path, helping users understand their location within the file system.
4. `man` (Manual): Provides detailed documentation for Linux commands, offering syntax, options, and usage examples.

Here's how these commands are typically used on Ubuntu Linux:

```bash
# Change to the roadmap user's documents directory
cd /home/roadmap/documents

# List contents of the current directory
ls

# Display the current working directory
pwd

# View the manual page for the 'ls' command
man ls
```
