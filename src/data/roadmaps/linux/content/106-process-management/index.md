# Process Management in Linux

Process management is a fundamental aspect of any operating system, and Linux is no exception. In Linux, every running program, whether an application or a system operation, is treated as a process. These processes work together to provide a seamless user experience.

Linux users can interact with and manage these processes using various commands for different process management tasks, such as viewing running processes, killing processes, and changing process priorities. Understanding these commands and how to use them effectively is essential for effective Linux process management.

The `ps` command, for example, provides information about the currently running processes:

```bash
roadmap@ubuntu:~$ ps aux
```

This will list all the currently running processes, including the process ID, the user running the process, the CPU and memory usage, and the command that started the process.

Another common command is `top`, which provides a live, updating view of the current system state, including running processes:

```bash
roadmap@ubuntu:~$ top
```

A powerful tool for managing processes is `kill`, which can send specific signals to processes. For example, you can gracefully stop a process with `SIGTERM` (15) or forcefully stop one with `SIGKILL` (9):

```bash
roadmap@ubuntu:~$ kill -SIGTERM pid
roadmap@ubuntu:~$ kill -SIGKILL pid
```

Replace `pid` with the process ID you want to stop.
