# Process Signals in Linux Process Management

In Linux, process management is a fundamental aspect of the system, involving the creation, scheduling, termination, and coordination of process execution. An essential component of this is process signals, which provide a communication mechanism for Unix and Linux systems.

Process signals are a way to notify a running process of synchronous or asynchronous events. There are various signals available, such as `SIGINT`, `SIGSTOP`, `SIGKILL`, and others, which can be used to interrupt, pause, or terminate a process.

For example, to send a `SIGSTOP` signal to a process with a PID of 12345 on a Ubuntu Linux system, you can use the `kill` command in the terminal:

```bash
kill -SIGSTOP 12345
```

This will suspend the execution of the process until a `SIGCONT` signal is received.
