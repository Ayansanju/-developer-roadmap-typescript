# TCP/IP

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is the foundation of internet protocols. It is a set of networking protocols that enables communication between two or more computers. In the context of Linux, TCP/IP networking is a fundamental part of the operating system's functionality, providing a platform for establishing connections and facilitating data transfer between endpoints.

TCP/IP plays a crucial role in allowing a host, with the right IP configuration, to connect and interact with other hosts on the same or different networks. It consists of a four-layer model: Network Interface, Internet, Transport, and Application. Understanding TCP/IP, its structure, and how it works is essential for effectively managing and troubleshooting Linux networks.

Here's an example command using the TCP/IP protocol in Ubuntu Linux:

```bash
# To view all active TCP/IP network connections
roadmap@ubuntu:~$ netstat -at
```

This command will display all active TCP/IP network connections on the system, providing valuable information for network management and troubleshooting.
