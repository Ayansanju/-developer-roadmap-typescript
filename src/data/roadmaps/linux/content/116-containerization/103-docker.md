# Docker and Containerization in Linux

Docker is a widely-used open-source platform that leverages OS-level virtualization, known as "containerization", to develop, package, and deploy applications effectively. Within the Linux ecosystem, Docker and containerization have revolutionized software development workflows by providing lightweight and isolated operational environments, called containers, for applications and their dependencies.

In Linux, each Docker container interacts directly with the Linux kernel. By utilizing features like namespaces and control groups (cgroups), these containers offer isolated spaces to run processes while sharing the same operating system, resulting in lower overhead compared to traditional virtual machines.

Here's a basic example of running a Docker container on Ubuntu Linux:

```bash
# Pull the Docker image from Docker Hub
sudo docker pull hello-world

# Run the Docker container
sudo docker run hello-world
```

The above commands allow you to download a Docker image from the Docker Hub registry and run it on your Ubuntu Linux system, providing the foundation for deploying containers in development, testing, and production environments.
