# Understanding Ulimits

Linux-based containerization technologies, such as Docker, utilize 'ulimits' as a security feature to control the resource consumption of each running container. Ulimits (user limits) are a feature of the Linux kernel that restricts the resources that any single user can consume, including open file handles, locked-in physical memory, and others.

Properly configuring and understanding ulimits is crucial, especially in containerized environments, to ensure optimal performance and security of all containers. By setting appropriate ulimits, you can prevent a rogue or errant process in a particular container from exhausting the server's resources and creating a denial-of-service situation for other containers or processes.

Here's an example of how to manage ulimits on an Ubuntu Linux system:

```bash
# To see the current ulimits:
ulimit -a

# To set a specific ulimit (soft limit), for example, the maximum number of open file handles:
ulimit -n 1024
```

In the example above, we use the `ulimit` command to view the current ulimits and set the maximum number of open file handles to 1024.
