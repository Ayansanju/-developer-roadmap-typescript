# Containerization

Containerization is a virtualization technique that encapsulates an application and its dependencies within a self-contained, isolated environment. This approach allows applications to run consistently and efficiently across different computing environments. In the Linux ecosystem, popular open-source platforms like Docker and Kubernetes are used to leverage containerization.

Containers are often contrasted with virtual machines (VMs). Unlike VMs, which require a complete operating system to run an application, containers share the host system's user space, making them lightweight and faster to start up.

In Linux, Docker is a widely-used tool for containerization. Here's a basic example of how to run a container in Docker on Ubuntu Linux:

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu:24.04 bash
```

This command pulls the Ubuntu Linux image from Docker Hub and runs it as a container on your system, providing you with an interactive terminal (`-it`) inside the container. This is a simple use case, but Docker can be used to manage complex applications involving multiple containers.
