# Introduction to NL (Number Lines)

The `nl` command in Linux is a utility for numbering lines in a text file. Also known as 'number lines', it can be handy when you need an overview of where certain lines are located in a file. By default, `nl` numbers the non-empty lines only, but this behavior can be modified based on user's needs.

The syntax for using the `nl` command is as follows:

```bash
nl [options] [file_name]
```

If no file is specified, `nl` will wait for input from the user's terminal (stdin). Its clear and readable output makes it a valuable tool for any Linux user's text processing toolkit.

Here's an example of using the `nl` command on a file named `example.txt` in the `/home/roadmap/documents` directory on Ubuntu Linux:

```bash
nl /home/roadmap/documents/example.txt
```

This will output the contents of the `example.txt` file with line numbers. You can also use various options with the `nl` command to customize the output, such as:

- `-b` to specify the type of line numbering (e.g., `-b a` to number all lines, `-b t` to number only non-empty lines)
- `-n` to specify the numbering format (e.g., `-n rz` to use right-justified numbers with leading zeros)
- `-s` to specify the separator between the line number and the line content
