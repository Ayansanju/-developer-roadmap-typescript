# Tr Command in Linux

The `tr` command in Linux is a powerful utility for character translation and manipulation. It reads input from the standard input stream and writes the transformed output to the standard output stream. While commonly used for character translation, `tr` offers versatile functionality in the realm of text processing within the Linux environment.

Here's a basic usage example on Ubuntu Linux:

```bash
echo 'hello' | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'
```

This command will convert the lowercase string 'hello' to the uppercase string 'HELLO'. The `tr` command is an essential tool for various text processing tasks, such as:

- Translating a set of characters to another set
- Deleting specific characters
- Squeezing or removing repeated characters
- Converting between uppercase and lowercase

Here are some more advanced examples of using the `tr` command on Ubuntu Linux:

1. Removing all non-alphanumeric characters from a string:

   ```bash
   echo 'roadmap@sh 2023!' | tr -cd 'a-zA-Z0-9'
   ```

2. Replacing all occurrences of a character with another:

   ```bash
   echo 'roadmap.sh' | tr '.' '-'
   ```

3. Translating uppercase letters to lowercase and vice versa:

   ```bash
   echo 'roadmap.sh' | tr 'A-Za-z' 'a-zA-Z'
   ```
