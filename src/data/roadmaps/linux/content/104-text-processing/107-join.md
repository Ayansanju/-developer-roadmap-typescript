# join Command in Text Processing on Linux

The `join` command in Linux is a powerful tool for text processing, allowing you to combine lines from two files based on a common field. It works similarly to the 'Join' operation in SQL, making it particularly useful when dealing with large volumes of data.

Suppose you have two files, one containing a list of items with their costs, and the other containing the quantities for those items. You can use the `join` command to combine these two files, so that each item has its cost and quantity on the same line.

```bash
# Syntax
join roadmap_items.txt roadmap_quantities.txt
```

It's important to note that the `join` command works properly only when the input files are sorted. Familiarizing yourself with the available options and flags is crucial to using `join` effectively in your text processing tasks.

Here's an example of using the `join` command on Ubuntu Linux:

```bash
# Sample data files
cat roadmap_items.txt
apple 5.99
banana 2.49
orange 3.79

cat roadmap_quantities.txt
apple 10
banana 15
orange 8

# Join the files
join roadmap_items.txt roadmap_quantities.txt
apple 5.99 10
banana 2.49 15
orange 3.79 8
```

In this example, the `join` command combines the information from the `roadmap_items.txt` and `roadmap_quantities.txt` files, creating a new output where each line contains the item, its cost, and its quantity.
