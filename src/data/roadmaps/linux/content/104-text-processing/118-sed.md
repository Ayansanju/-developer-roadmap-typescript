# SED in Text Processing

The `sed` command in Linux is a powerful stream editor used for performing basic text transformations on files or standard input. It processes text line by line, allowing you to search, replace, insert, and delete text in a non-interactive way. `sed` is particularly useful for batch processing and automated text manipulations in scripts.

A common usage of `sed` is substituting a specific string with another. By default, it prints the modified content to the terminal but does not modify the file unless explicitly instructed.

```bash
sed 's/old_text/new_text/g' file.txt
```

In this example:

- `s`: Stands for "substitute." It indicates that a substitution will be performed.
- `old_text`: The string you want to replace.
- `new_text`: The replacement string
- `g`: (Optional) Makes the substitution global, replacing all occurrences of old_text in each line.

Replace Text in a File:

```bash
sed 's/hello/world/' file.txt
```

This command searches for the first occurrence of "hello" in each line of `file.txt` and replaces it with "world". Since no `g` flag is used, only the first occurrence in each line will be replaced.

Replace and Save to the Same File:

```bash
sed -i 's/foo/bar/g' filename
```

The `-i` option stands for "in-place," meaning that the changes will be saved directly to `filename`. The command replaces every occurrence of "foo" with "bar" throughout the entire file.

Delete Lines:

```bash
sed '/pattern/d' filename
```

This command removes any line in filename that contains "pattern." The `d` flag tells `sed` to delete those lines.
