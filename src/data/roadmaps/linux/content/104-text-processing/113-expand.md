# Expanding Tabs to Spaces in Linux

The `expand` command is a powerful tool in Unix and Unix-like operating systems, such as Ubuntu Linux, that allows you to convert tab characters into spaces. This can be particularly useful when working with Linux shell scripts or other text-based files where consistent indentation is crucial for code readability.

By default, the `expand` command converts tabs into 8 spaces. Here's an example of how to use it:

```bash
expand roadmap_script.sh
```

In this example, the `roadmap_script.sh` file will have its tab characters replaced with 8 spaces, and the output will be displayed on the console.

If you prefer a different number of spaces per tab, you can use the `-t` option:

```bash
expand -t 4 roadmap_script.sh
```

This will replace each tab character with 4 spaces, which can be helpful when working with code editors that have different tab settings.

The `expand` command is a simple yet effective tool for maintaining consistent formatting in your Linux text files. By ensuring that tabs are consistently converted to spaces, you can improve the readability and maintainability of your code, especially when collaborating with others or working across different systems.
