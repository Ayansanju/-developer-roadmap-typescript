# awk - Powerful Text Processing in Linux

awk is a versatile programming language designed for efficient text manipulation and data extraction on Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. Named after its three original developers - Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Brian Kernighan, awk excels at tasks such as sorting, filtering, and generating reports from text files.

The awk language operates by defining pattern-action pairs within a script. It reads an input file line by line, identifies patterns that match the specified criteria, and executes corresponding actions on those matches. This powerful approach makes awk a valuable tool for automating text-based tasks in shell scripts.

Here's an example of how to print the first two fields of each line in a file using awk on Ubuntu Linux:

```bash
awk '{print $1, $2}' /roadmap/data.txt
```

This command will display the first and second fields (typically separated by spaces) of every line in the `/roadmap/data.txt` file.
