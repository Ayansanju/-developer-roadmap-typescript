# WC - Text Processing

The `wc` (word count) command is a powerful tool in Linux that allows users to count the number of bytes, characters, words, and lines in a file or in data piped from standard input. It's an invaluable utility for analyzing text at both granular and larger scales, such as tracking program output, counting code lines, and more.

Here's an example of using `wc` in Ubuntu Linux:

```bash
wc roadmap.txt
```

This command will output the number of lines, words, and characters in the `roadmap.txt` file, displayed in the following order:

```
  10  100 1000 roadmap.txt
```

This output indicates that the file has 10 lines, 100 words, and 1000 characters.

You can also use `wc` to count the number of lines, words, or characters individually by using the following options:

- `-l`: Count the number of lines
- `-w`: Count the number of words
- `-c`: Count the number of characters

For example, to count the number of lines in the `roadmap.txt` file, you can use:

```bash
wc -l roadmap.txt
```

This will output only the line count:

```
10 roadmap.txt
```
