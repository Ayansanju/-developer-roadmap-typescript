# Tail Command

The `tail` command in Linux is a powerful utility used for text processing. It is primarily used to display the last part of a file, allowing users to quickly access the most recent entries, such as those found in log files.

Here's how you can use the `tail` command:

```bash
tail /var/log/syslog
```

This command will display the last 10 lines of the `/var/log/syslog` file. You can customize the number of lines displayed by using the `-n` option followed by the desired number of lines:

```bash
tail -n 20 /var/log/syslog
```

This will display the last 20 lines of the `/var/log/syslog` file.

Another useful option is `-f`, which allows you to continuously monitor a file and display new lines as they are added. This is particularly helpful when you're troubleshooting an issue and need to keep track of the latest log entries:

```bash
tail -f /var/log/syslog
```

This command will display the last 10 lines of the `/var/log/syslog` file and then continue to monitor the file, showing new lines as they are added.

You can also use the `tail` command to display the last part of multiple files at once:

```bash
tail /var/log/syslog /var/log/apache2/access.log
```

This will display the last 10 lines of both the `/var/log/syslog` and `/var/log/apache2/access.log` files.
