# Stdout and Stderr in Linux

In the Linux operating system, when a program is executed, three primary communication channels are typically opened: STDIN (Standard Input), STDOUT (Standard Output), and STDERR (Standard Error). Understanding the distinction between these channels is crucial for effective text processing and scripting.

STDOUT is the channel through which the normal output from most shell commands is sent. This is where the expected results of a command are typically displayed. STDERR, on the other hand, is specifically used for sending error messages and other diagnostic information.

Here's an example of how to redirect STDOUT and STDERR in a Bash script running on Ubuntu Linux:

```bash
command > /home/roadmap/stdout.txt 2> /home/roadmap/stderr.txt
```

In this example, the `>` operator redirects the standard output (STDOUT) to a file named `stdout.txt` in the `/home/roadmap` directory, while the `2>` operator redirects the standard error (STDERR) to a file named `stderr.txt` in the same directory.
