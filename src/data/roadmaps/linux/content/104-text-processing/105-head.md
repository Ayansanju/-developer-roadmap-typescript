# Head Command

The `head` command in Linux is a powerful tool for quickly previewing the start of a file without loading the entire document into memory. It is particularly useful for examining the contents of large files.

By default, the `head` command prints the first 10 lines of a file to the terminal. However, you can customize the number of output lines using the `-n` option followed by the desired number of lines.

For example, to display the first 5 lines of the file `roadmap.txt` on your Ubuntu Linux system, you can use the following command:

```bash
head -n 5 ~/roadmap.txt
```

This will output the first 5 lines of the `roadmap.txt` file located in your home directory.
