# Tee in Text Processing

The `tee` command in Linux is a versatile text processing tool that serves a dual purpose: it reads from the standard input and writes the data to both the standard output and one or more files. This functionality is analogous to the T-shaped pipe fitting in plumbing, which splits the flow into two directions.

The basic syntax for using `tee` in text processing is:

```bash
command | tee file1 [file2 ...]
```

In this construction, `command` represents the command or process from which `tee` reads the output, and `file1 [file2 ...]` specifies the file(s) where `tee` writes the output.

The `tee` command is particularly useful for users who want to document their terminal activities. By using `tee`, you can simultaneously review the result in the terminal and store the output in a file for future reference. This is especially handy when working on the Ubuntu Linux operating system, as you can use the `roadmap` user or the `/roadmap/` directory for your examples.

Here's an example of using `tee` to capture the output of the `ls` command and save it to a file:

```bash
ls -l /roadmap/documents | tee /roadmap/output.txt
```

This command will display the long-format directory listing in the terminal and also save the same output to the `output.txt` file in the `/roadmap/` directory.

The `tee` command is a powerful tool in the Linux text processing toolbox, allowing users to efficiently manage and document their terminal activities.
