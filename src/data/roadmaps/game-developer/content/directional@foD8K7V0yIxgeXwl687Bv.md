# Directional Light

In 3D graphics, shadows are essential for creating more realistic scenes. A popular technique for generating real-time shadows is through the use of *stencil shadows*. A key light source within this technique is the **Directional Light**.

## What is a Directional Light?

A **Directional Light** simulates a light source coming from an infinite distance, similar to sunlight. Unlike point lights, which emit light from a specific position, a **Directional Light** affects all objects in the scene uniformly, as if the light is coming from an infinite distance, sending parallel rays in a fixed direction.
