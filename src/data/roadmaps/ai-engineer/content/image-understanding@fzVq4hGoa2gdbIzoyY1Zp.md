# Image Understanding
Multimodal prompts combine text and image inputs to enable a variety of use cases like image classification, handwriting recognition, and translation. Simple prompts can be used for tasks like object recognition, entity classification, and object counting..The multimodal embeddings feature allows the AI system to understand the mutual relationship between images and text, enabling more effective text-based image search and retrieval. This multimodal understanding is a key capability for advanced image analysis and understanding.
