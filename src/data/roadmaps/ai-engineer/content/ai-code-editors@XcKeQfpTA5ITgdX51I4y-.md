# AI Code Editors

AI code editors, also known as AI-powered Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), are advanced development tools that leverage artificial intelligence to assist software developers in writing, debugging, and optimizing code. These editors go beyond traditional syntax highlighting and code completion by incorporating machine learning models, natural language processing, and data analysis to understand code context, generate suggestions, and even automate portions of the software development process.
