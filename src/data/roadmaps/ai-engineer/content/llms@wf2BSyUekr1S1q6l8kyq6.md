# LLMs

LLMs are large language models that predict the next word based on input text and learn from massive datasets. They are the basis for chatbots, generative AI, and other applications, but they also face challenges such as bias, accuracy, and scalability.

Modern LLMs emerged in 2017 and use transformer models, which are neural networks commonly referred to as transformers. With a large number of parameters and the transformer model, LLMs are able to understand and generate accurate responses rapidly, which makes the AI technology broadly applicable across many different domains.

LLMs operate by leveraging deep learning techniques and vast amounts of textual data. These models are typically based on a transformer architecture, like the generative pre-trained transformer, which excels at handling sequential data like text input.
