# Redis vs SQL/NoSQL DBs

Redis, SQL, and NoSQL databases are different types of data storage solutions, each designed to solve specific use cases based on data structure, scalability, performance, and flexibility.

- **Redis** is an in-memory key-value store known for its high performance and low latency, often used for caching, real-time analytics, and message brokering. It stores data in RAM, which allows fast access, but it may not be suitable for large datasets that exceed available memory.
  
- **SQL (Structured Query Language)** databases are relational databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL, which use a predefined schema with tables and relationships. SQL databases are ideal for structured data and ensure ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance, making them reliable for transactions, but less flexible for unstructured data.

- **NoSQL** databases like MongoDB or Cassandra are non-relational and schema-less, designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data with high flexibility. They are optimized for large-scale, distributed data and horizontal scaling, but may sacrifice some consistency in favor of availability and partition tolerance (CAP theorem).

Understanding the distinctions between Redis, SQL, and NoSQL databases helps developers choose the right tool depending on factors like speed, scalability, data structure, and use case requirements.
