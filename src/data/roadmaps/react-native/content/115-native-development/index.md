# Native Development

Your application may need access to platform features that arenâ€™t directly available from react-native or one of the hundreds of third-party libraries maintained by the community. Maybe you want to reuse some existing Objective-C, Swift, Java, Kotlin or C++ code from the JavaScript runtime. Whatever your reason, React Native exposes a powerful set of API to connect your native code to your JavaScript application code.

This guide introduces:

- **Native Modules:** native libraries that have no User Interface (UI) for the user. Examples would be persistent storage, notifications, network events. These are accessible to your user as JavaScript functions and objects.
- **Native Component:** native platform views, widgets and controllers that are available to your application's JavaScript code through React Components.
